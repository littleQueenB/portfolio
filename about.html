        <h1>All About me</h1>
        <p id="Paragraph1">My name is Aaliyah Brown. I am 15 years old. I was born in Abington, PA. But I was raised all over the country. I
            lived in multiple places in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, New Jersey, Tennessee, Mexico, Barbados and many other
            places. I now live in Glenside in the Cheltenham District in PA, next to where I was born.</p>
        <p id="Paragraph2">I have been running track for 10 years. I am hoping to go to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. I will be 17 when it happens. I am already in training. I love the arts. I love singing, dancing, drawing, modeling, and performing. I want to have a career in those as well as track.</p>
